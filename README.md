Dataset for the paper entitled, Keyphrase Extraction from Scholarly Articles as Sequence Labeling using Contextualized Embeddings.


This repository contains only the datasets used in the experiments and their overview

For more details on how the dataset was created, and the models trained on them,
please refer to our paper, [Keyphrase Extraction from Scholarly Articles as Sequence Labeling using Contextualized Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08840)

We ran our experiments on three different publicly available keyphrase extraction datasets: 
1. [Inspec](https://github.com/midas-research/keyphrase-extraction-as-sequence-labeling-data/tree/master/Inspec) (Hulth 2003), 
2. [SemEval-2010](https://github.com/midas-research/keyphrase-extraction-as-sequence-labeling-data/tree/master/processed_semeval-2010) (Kim et al. 2010) (referred to as SE- 2010), 
3. [SemEval-2017](https://github.com/midas-research/keyphrase-extraction-as-sequence-labeling-data/tree/master/SemEval-2017) (Augenstein et al. 2017) (referred to as SE-2017)
